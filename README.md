<h2>Description</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Trunfo (also known as Trumps, Top Trumps, or Super Trumps) is a card game that originated in the UK in the 1960s. The game consists of a deck of cards, each featuring a different theme such as cars, animals, or sports. Each card has several categories, such as speed, power, or weight, along with a numerical value for each category.

The game is typically played by two or more players. At the beginning of each round, one player selects a category from their top card and announces it to the other players. The other players then compare the same category on their own top card and the player with the highest value for that category wins the round, collecting all of the cards that were played in that round. The winner then selects the category for the next round.

The game continues until one player has collected all of the cards in the deck, or until time runs out. The winner is the player with the most cards at the end of the game.

Trunfo is a fun and easy-to-learn game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. It is also a great way to learn about different topics, as each deck of cards typically features a different theme with interesting facts and figures.
